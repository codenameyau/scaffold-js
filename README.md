# scaffold-js

Generators and scaffolding tools come with a lot of cruft. Most of the time, all I want are the configuration files, which you can now create like so: 

```
scaffold-js
```

### Installation

```
sudo npm install -g scaffold-js
```

To use the ES6 babel-compiler for eslint, you'll need to install:

```
sudo npm install -g babel babel-eslint eslint
```
